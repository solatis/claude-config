## Acknowledgments

`prompt-engineering.md` is extracted from [Southbridge Research's exceptional analysis of Claude Code prompts](https://southbridge-research.notion.site/Prompt-Engineering-The-Art-of-Instructing-AI-2055fec70db181369002dcdea7d9e732). This document has been invaluable for understanding and applying advanced prompt engineering techniques.

When optimizing prompts with these techniques:
```
Apply ALL prompt engineering patterns from `prompt-engineering.md` to this modification. For EACH change, specify EXACTLY which technique(s) you used:
- Pattern name (e.g., "Progressive Disclosure", "Emphasis Hierarchy")
- Why this pattern applies here
- Expected behavioral impact

CRITICAL: Changes without pattern attribution = task incomplete.
```
